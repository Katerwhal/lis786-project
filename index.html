<h2>Professional Profile</h2>
    <p>Kate Erickson is a Library and Information Science professional and MLIS student at Dominican University with a strong foundation in archives, metadata, and information organization. Her work is grounded in a commitment to increasing access to information and creating systems that help people discover, understand, and use collections more effectively. She approaches library and archival work with a focus on clarity, consistency, and thoughtful description, recognizing the role that well-designed systems play in shaping access.
    <br><br>
    Through her academic training and professional experience, Kate has developed strengths in metadata creation, standards-based description, workflow development, and systems thinking. She is comfortable working across descriptive frameworks and enjoys learning how underlying structures—such as metadata schemas, databases, and software systems—function and interact. This interest in systems has shaped her ability to move between technical detail and user-centered access, allowing her to design processes that are both precise and practical.
    <br><br>
    Kate brings a strong background in accuracy, documentation, and process improvement from her prior work in highly regulated, data-driven environments. These experiences inform her approach to library and archival practice, particularly in areas of quality control, consistency, and clear communication. She is skilled at learning complex systems, identifying opportunities for improvement, and translating that knowledge into workflows and documentation that support collaborative work.
    <br><br>
    Across her work, Kate values curiosity, collaboration, and reflective practice. She is especially interested in the ways libraries and archives can preserve local history, support community knowledge, and lower barriers to access through thoughtful organization and description. Her professional goals center on building sustainable, transparent systems that connect people with information in meaningful and equitable ways.
